## Description   
✅ graph_sage_vs_gcn_play.py     
Comparison of relative performance of GraphSAGE and GCN over PyTorch Geometric datasets. The list evaluation parameters include number of graph SAGE or convolutional layers, scope of neighborhood message aggregation and homophily.   
    
✅ graph_to_simplicial_complex_play.py     
Description, design and implementation of the process of lifting of graphs to simplicial complexes using PyTorch Geometric datasets.    
   
✅ abstract_simplicial_complex_play.py    
Introduction and evaluation of simplicial complexes using TopoNetX library, including computation of incidence matrices and various Laplacians.
